# Variant Annotator

Variant Annotator is a Figma plugin that annotates Variant Properties for multiple components instantly. All you have to is select multiple component instances and run the plugin. A text box is generated with variant properties for every selection. This makes annotating components for creating developer specs a breeze, especially in design systems work.
